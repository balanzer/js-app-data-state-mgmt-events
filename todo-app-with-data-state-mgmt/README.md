## Mirage

Mirage is a JavaScript library that lets frontend developers mock out backend APIs.

### How it works

Mirage runs in the browser. It intercepts any XMLHttpRequest or fetch requests your JavaScript app makes and lets you mock the response. That means you can develop and test your app just as if it were talking to a real server.
